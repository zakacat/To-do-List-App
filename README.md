# **Zakacat's ToDo List App**
## **Purpose**

This is the source code to make a ToDo list app with android studio for android phones. This was an assignment for a college course DGL-114 Intro to App Development. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize the student ("Hey, that's me.") with:

- Creating functional and interactive dialogs
- Working with fragments
- Utilizing local (private) storage
- Working with user gesture detection
- Lifecycle methods
- ArrayLists
- Constructing and using app bar menus

## **About the App**

The user can add any text to the ToDo list by clicking the add button in the app bar menu. The input will then be displayed with a corresponding number. If the app is exited, the list will be saved for the next time that it is opened.

## **Contributors**

The initial set of files was provided by the instructor of the course. Most of the files were taken from the text with our instructions being - to improve and modify the app. Outside of the initial file set, I worked solo, but several modifications were still made.

## **Modifications**

- Added an app bar menu
- Added logic to handle add item dialog
- Added a fragment to create the dialog
- Added a drawable for the app bar menu
- Tidied up the code to match the new design

## **License**
 Currently none.
